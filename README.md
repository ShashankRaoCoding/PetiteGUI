# PetiteGUI
A simple GUI library for Python. This is made in Python using the PyGame library in conjunction with Win32api, Win32gui, and Win32con. This is not a very complex library, but gives the basic tools required for making GUIs for Python projects. 

This is the first module I have written, and there is much work to be done, yet. I am still learning how to create libraries and manage liscencing. Please do feel free to use this module if you can find a use for it in your own projects. Many more features, such as interactable screen objects will likely be added in the near future.
